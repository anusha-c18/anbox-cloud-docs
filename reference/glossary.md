    The images can be an Anbox Cloud AOSP image which is based on the Android Open Source Project (AOSP), an operating system typically used in mobile devices or an Anbox Cloud AAOS image which is based on the Android Automotive OS (AAOS), an infotainment platform used in automobiles.

    See {ref}`howto-manage-images` and {ref}`ref-provided-images` for more information.

Instance
    An instance is a container or a virtual machine used to launch an application or an image. Every time you launch an application or an image, Anbox Cloud creates an instance for it. Every instance provides a full Android system.

    See {ref}`exp-instances` for more information.

Instance type
    An abstraction for a set of resources that is available to an instance.

    See {ref}`sec-application-manifest-instance-type` for more information.

    ```{note}

    ```

Juju
    A charmed operator framework that helps you deploy, integrate and manage applications across multiple environments. Anbox Cloud is installed using Juju. The Anbox Cloud Appliance uses Juju under the hood.

    See [the Juju website](https://juju.is/) for more information.

LXD cluster
    A set of LXD nodes that share the same distributed database that holds the configuration for the cluster members and their instances.

LXD worker node
    In a clustering setup for a charmed Anbox Cloud deployment, all nodes other than the [control node](#control-node) are worker nodes. If you have a streaming stack, all nodes other than the control node and the two nodes that are dedicated to host the streaming services are worker nodes. Each worker node runs LXD in clustering mode, and this LXD cluster is used to host the Android containers.
