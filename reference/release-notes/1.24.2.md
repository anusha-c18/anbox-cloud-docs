* The [out-of-band v2](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/anbox-cloud/en/latest/howto/stream/exchange-oob-data/) feature does not work when VM images are in use because of strict system hardening security directives. These directives cause the `anbox-webrtc-data-proxy` unit to fail to start. For more information, see [LP 2093887](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2093887).
