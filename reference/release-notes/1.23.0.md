# 1.23.0

The Anbox Cloud team is pleased to announce the release of Anbox Cloud 1.23.0.

Please see [component versions](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/anbox-cloud/en/latest/reference/component-versions) for a list of updated components.

## New features & improvements

### Anbox Cloud Appliance
The Anbox Cloud Appliance is overhauled to deliver a much simpler and streamlined version. This new version of the appliance is made available using the [snap epoch feature](https://snapcraft.io/docs/snap-epochs). Existing installations of the appliance are not affected but the old snap with `epoch=0` is {ref}`deprecated <sec-appliance-deprecation>`. For all new installations of the appliance, use the `epoch=1` snap. See the [appliance installation tutorial](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/anbox-cloud/en/latest/tutorial/installing-appliance/) for instructions.

The `anbox-cloud-appliance status` command now displays the initialization status of the appliance and its version. <!--AC-2513-->

### Seamless ADB connections

Anbox Cloud now offers a way to connect to remote Android instances securely using the Android Debug Bridge (ADB). You can set up an ADB connection using the dashboard or the CLI. See {ref}`howto-access-instance` for more information.

### Full support for AAOS

Android Automotive OS based images are fully supported starting from this release and no longer considered an experimental feature.<!--AC-2660-->

### Anbox Cloud dashboard

The Anbox Cloud dashboard has the following improvements:

* The *Instances* and the *Sessions* pages and their functionalities are merged to provide an enhanced user experience while creating and streaming an application.
* The initial VHAL values upon joining a stream are now captured as a default. You can revert to these values using the *Reset* button, while you are on the stream page.
* You can easily authorize ADB connections for any stream-enabled instance from the dashboard.

### Anbox Cloud charms

All Anbox Cloud charms now install Snaps directly from the Snap Store instead of using deb packages. Existing installations automatically switch to snap refresh from the store on upgrade.<!--AC-2523-->

### Android vendor image

The Android vendor images used in Anbox are now based on Android 14. Building on the latest version of Android helps us provide the latest updates and security fixes.

### Security updates

Android security updates for August 2024 (see [Android Security Bulletin - August 2024](https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2024-08-01) for more information).

### WebView updates

The Android WebView has been updated to [127.0.6533.84](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2024/07/chrome-for-android-update_30.html).

### Documentation

Our documentation is now hosted at [documentation.ubuntu.com](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/anbox-cloud/en/latest). Previous documentation links from the [earlier website](https://anbox-cloud.io) will be redirected to new targets.

The documentation source is hosted at the public [Anbox Cloud documentation repository on GitHub](https://github.com/canonical/anbox-cloud-docs). We welcome all contributions to the Anbox Cloud documentation using this repository. See [Contribute to Anbox Cloud documentation](https://documentation.ubuntu.com/anbox-cloud/en/latest/contribute/landing/) for more information.

## Removed functionality

Support for EmuGL is removed with this release.

## Deprecations

Use of a node controller to manage port forwarding from an instance is deprecated, starting with this release. In 1.23.0, the node controller will still be used for the full Anbox Cloud deployment. For the appliance, the Anbox Management Service (AMS) now uses a LXD proxy device to manage the port forwarding from an instance to expose a service externally or internally.

In the 1.24.0 release, the node controller will be fully replaced with LXD proxy device for both regular and appliance deployments.<!--AC--2487-->

## Known issues

* WiFi support is not available with any of the images. This issue will be fixed in the 1.23.1 release. <!--AC-2647-->
* No crash dump is generated for the `anbox session` or `container-manager` process when running an Anbox session on ARM64.
* Occasionally, the VHAL panel will not show up on AAOS streams. Reloading the stream page fixes the issue in most cases. In case it doesn't, restarting the instance will fix the issue.
* In a multi-cluster deployment that has more than one AMS, you cannot use a single web dashboard to control all the clusters in the deployment.
* When connecting to an Android instance using `anbox-connect <connection_url>`, you might occasionally encounter the following error:
    ```
    Failed to communicate with the signaler:  Failed to add ICE candidate: InvalidStateError: remote description is not set
    ```
    Retrying the command resolves the issue.
* In the Anbox Cloud appliance, a service declared to be publicly available in the application manifest is not exposed publicly. If your deployment is behind a NAT, you can run the following command to overcome this issue:
    ```
    amc node set lxd0 public-address <public-address-of-lxd0>
    ```
* Disabling GPU accelerated encoding (setting `video-encoder` to `software` in an application's manifest) for instances causes Anbox to fail on startup due to incorrectly linking the NVIDIA encoding libraries. See the [bug report on Launchpad](https://bugs.launchpad.net/anbox-cloud/+bug/2076893) for more information.
