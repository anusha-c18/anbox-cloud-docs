These release notes cover new features and changes in Anbox Cloud 1.23.1.

Anbox Cloud 1.23.1 is a patch release. To understand minor and patch releases, see {ref}`ref-release-notes`.

Please see {ref}`ref-component-versions` for a list of updated components.

## Requirements

See the {ref}`ref-requirements` for details on general and deployment specific requirements to run Anbox Cloud.

## New features & improvements

### Anbox Cloud Appliance

* You can now set the following appliance network configuration using `anbox-cloud-appliance config set`:<!--AC-2732-->
  - The network's public IP address (`network.public_address`)
  - The network's DNS name (`network.location`)<!--AC-2727-->.
* You can now configure the [CORS settings](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) for those API endpoints that the appliance reverse proxy passes to the Anbox Stream Gateway. You can set the following using the `anbox-cloud-appliance config set` command:<!--AC-2732-->
  - The [HTTP origin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Origin) (`core.https_allowed_origin`)
  - List of allowed HTTP headers (`core.https_allowed_headers`)
  - List of allowed HTTP methods (`core.https_allowed_methods`)
* You can skip setting up coturn when initializing the appliance and can configure a custom STUN server.<!--AC-2719-->
* The [`prepare-node-script`](prepare-node-script.md) command is extended to support systems with an already installed NVIDIA driver. <!--AC-2714-->
* You can now set up a custom identity provider for the dashboard by configuring an OpenID Connect provider through the preseed configuration when initializing the appliance.

### Streaming

* With the 1.23.0 release, the functionalities of the *Instances* page and the *Sessions* page on the web dashboard were merged. For debugging purposes, viewing a list of available sessions can be really useful. With the 1.23.1 release, you can list all available sessions using the `anbox-stream-gateway sessions list` command.<!--AC-2662-->
* You can dynamically change the display density when joining an existing streaming session.<!--AC-2673-->

### VHAL

* Starting with 1.23.0, the VNDK version required for building a custom VHAL is 34.<!--AC-2720-->

### Android vendor image

* WiFi support for all Android versions.<!--AC-2707-->

### Other

* Android security updates for September 2024 (see [Android Security Bulletin - September 2024](https://source.android.com/docs/security/bulletin/2024-09-01) for more information). <!--AC-2712-->
* The Android WebView has been updated to [128.0.6613.127](https://chromereleases.googleblog.com/2024/09/chrome-for-android-update.html).

## Known issues

* Since version 1.23.0, the Anbox WebRTC Data Proxy service starts on demand rather than at container startup. However, its startup time may take longer than expected, which can negatively impact the {ref}`out-of-band data exchange <sec-oob-data-version-2>` between the WebRTC server and client. This issue can be worked around by applying the following tweak in a [pre-start hook](https://anbox-cloud.io/docs/ref/hooks).

  ```
  #!/bin/sh -ex
  if  [ "$CONTAINER_TYPE" = "regular" ]; then
    exit 0
  fi

  DROP_IN_DIR=/etc/systemd/system/anbox-webrtc-data-proxy.service.d/
  sudo mkdir -p "${DROP_IN_DIR}"
  sudo tee "${DROP_IN_DIR}/override.conf" > /dev/null <<EOF
  [Install]
  WantedBy=multi-user.target
  EOF

  sudo systemctl daemon-reload
  sudo systemctl enable anbox-webrtc-data-proxy
  ```

* Launching a VM image with default size fails with the following error: <!--LP 2076907-->

      $ amc launch -r --vm jammy:android13:arm64
      Error: Failed creating instance from image: Source image size (16106127360) exceeds specified volume size (15000010752)

  To work around this issue, specify a disk size when launching the image:

      $ amc launch -r --vm jammy:android13:arm64 --disk-size 20GB
