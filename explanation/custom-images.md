# Custom images

Android Automotive OS(AAOS) includes reference designs that can be customized. Car makers will typically adapt these reference designs to fit their needs in terms of user experience. Additionally, most of them will complement the reference designs with features or functionalities of their own.

To enable such use cases, we support customized AAOS images integration with Anbox Cloud. Hence, building custom images of Anbox Cloud based on custom AAOS is possible.

```{note}
Building custom images is currently possible only for Android 13 and AAOS images.
```

By default, Anbox Cloud is regularly updated with security updates provided by the Android team to keep systems secure for consumers of generic AAOS images. Anbox Cloud users using a custom AAOS image are expected to maintain their systems secure by integrating these security updates, along with the updated version of Anbox Cloud. This might require manual deployment steps.

If you are using or have a need for an Anbox Cloud image built on customized AAOS, please [contact us](https://anbox-cloud.io/contact-us).
