# Anbox Cloud documentation

This repository hosts the product documentation for Anbox Cloud.

**Important:**
The concepts of the Anbox component in Anbox Cloud are similar to the [Anbox open source project](https://github.com/anbox/anbox), but the Anbox open source project is an independent project that is not related to or used in Anbox Cloud.

### First-time contributors

    Contributing to the Anbox Cloud docs is a great way to improve your documentation and technical communication skills. You’ll get experience writing clear, concise documentation following [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/) principles.

- Learn more about Anbox Cloud

    Contributing to the Anbox Cloud documentation can help you broaden your understanding of the product and its related technologies.

    As a user of Anbox Cloud, you’re encouraged to collaborate with other users and participate in discussions in the [Discourse forum](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/c/anbox-cloud/users/148).

### Style and language

Anbox Cloud documentation follows [Diátaxis](https://diataxis.fr/) principles. Before starting to contribute, we encourage you to get familiar with Diátaxis.

To accommodate different kinds of audience, try to:

- Write content in a tone that’s appropriate for the subject.
- Write inclusively and assume very little prior knowledge of the reader.
- Link or explain phrases, acronyms and concepts that may be unfamiliar, and if unsure, err on the side of caution.

We (mostly) adhere to the [Ubuntu style guide](https://docs.ubuntu.com/styleguide/en). Any deviations from the Ubuntu style guide are documented in the [Anbox Cloud documentation style guide](./contribute/anbox-style-guide.md).

To help with syntax, there is a [cheat sheet](./contribute/doc-cheat-sheet.md) that lists the syntax for commonly used Markdown and MyST markup. For more detailed guidance, see the [MyST style guide](https://canonical-documentation-with-sphinx-and-readthedocscom.readthedocs-hosted.com/style-guide-myst/).
